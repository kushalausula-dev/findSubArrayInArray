# Best way to search sub array in an give array 

This repo is to demonstrate best solution for finding sub array in a given array - varied approaches and their respective tradeoffs.

1. first we would try with worst solution with 2 inner loops which has Big O notation of n^2 which is not at all accepted.
2. We shall try to bring it to O(n) approach using map. but this approach has trade off with memory as space complexity would be O(1)
